# Verifying Deep Keyword Spotting Detection with Acoustic Word Embeddings 
This repo contains code for our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9003781). It presents a noval template matching method based on acoustic word embeddings (AWE) as the second stage to verify the detection from the Deep keyword spotting (KWD) system. 

## Environmental Dependencies and Libraries
The codebase is developed with Python 3.7. Install requirements as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
